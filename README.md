The list of the projects, that i worked on with attached description

1.  [Maze runner](https://github.com/Unmystic/Maze-runner). Simple, one-layout labyrinth runner with semi-random location of checkpoint flags. Written in Lua, with use of  Love2d game engine. My attempt to adapt basic programming skills to use different language and create valid application.
2.  [League Simulator-QT6](https://github.com/Unmystic/LeagueSimulationGui). Gui application, that simulates round robin tournament. Creates set pairs of fictiotius sports teams, generates the calendar and simulates games between them. Uses QT6 multi-platform library
